    // Without keep-alive and when the handling of request is mainly CPU-bound
    // you would use about N threads (with N being the number of CPUs).
    // When processing requests contains wait times (e.g. because of I/O) you
    // would have to increase the number of threads to N*(1+WT/ST) with WT/ST being the ratio
    // of wait time to service time.

    // E.g. see Brian Goetz, Java theory and practice: Thread pools and work queues
    // http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp0730.html
    //
    // With keep-alive in place, configuration becomes harder because you have
    // to figure out both, keep-alive timeouts and the number of threads. With a long too long timeout
    // you might keep open many connections and threads waiting for requests and using system resources.
    //
    // One possibility is to decouple connections and threads by putting open, waiting connections into
    // a list which is monitored for new data. When new data arrives the requests are scheduled again
    // for processing. (not implemented here)
